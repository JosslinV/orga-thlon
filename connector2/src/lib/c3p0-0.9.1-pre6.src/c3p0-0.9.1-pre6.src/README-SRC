Hi.

Building c3p0 should be as easy as editing build.properties and typing ant.
Please send any feedback / questions to Steve Waldman <swaldman@mchange.com>

All of the test related properties are very optional. There are various
test tasks in the build file, but they are ad-hoc and unsupported. Someday
I plan to get with jUnit and do real testing, but that day has not yet come. 
Until then, you, my dear user, are my primary testing engine. Sorry.
