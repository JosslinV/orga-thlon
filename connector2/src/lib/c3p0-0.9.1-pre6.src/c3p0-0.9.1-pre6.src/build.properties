# >> BASICS <<

#
# You'll need to supply at least one of j2ee.classpath
# or j2ee.jar.file.base.dir. All jar files under
# ${j2ee.jar.file.base.dir} or its subdirectories
# will be added to the effective classpath of the project.
#

#j2ee.classpath=
#j2ee.jar.base.dir=

# >> DEBUGGING AND TRACING <<

# Set this to true if you want logging enabled for logging levels below INFO.
# If debug is not set, logging code for these messages will be eliminated from
# the compiled code by virtue of "if (false) { ... }" blocks.

#c3p0-build.debug=

# Set trace to an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive) to control how the level
# of detail of debug logging messages. Only makes a difference if c3p0.debug is
# set to true above. Default to 5 if unset.

#c3p0-build.trace=

# NOTE: You must still configure your logging library to log or display these 
# debug level messages if you actually want to see any change!

# >> OPTIONAL LIBRARY SUPPRT <<

#
# You'll only need this property if you want to
# build-in optional log4j support.

# via scp. Requires an available executable "scp".
# 
# this is a convenience for c3p0's developer, not
# really intended for other users. just leave blank
#
# note that virtual.host modifies a jboss-web.xml file,
# will do nothing if you are deploying to some other
# app server
